- instead of using an application.min.js and application.min.css, 
  allow the option to inline everything on the page (not a good idea
  for sites, a very good idea for single-page apps)
- use the connect.compress middleware (gzip/deflate) for our server
- update to express 3.0 once it's there
- use pngcrush when available and when writing to a file-based bundle
  (or is that an arbitrary distinction?)
