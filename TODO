- implement compilation and concatenation, with the help of the `Tilt.js` module
- implement *pre*compilation for templates
- create a separate build option that writes the concatenated files away to a directory
  (-o --output)
- allow building and serving to use an index file in any kind of template language we support, not just plain HTML -- the same flexibility we allow for other scripts and styles
- implement the -r --resource-root flag to support separate hosting environments for static files (chiefly CDNs)
- implement -p --port for server port
- -i --ignore (using the .gitignore format) for files that shouldn't be included in the build
- -n --noop (using the .gitignore format) for files that should be in the build but shouldn't be
  processed (not even if they're, say, a CoffeeScript file)
- use the connect.compress middleware (gzip/deflate) for our server
- update to express 3.0 once it's there
